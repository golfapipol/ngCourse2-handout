# Forms
An app without user any user input is really just a page. Capturing input from the user is the cornerstone of any application. In many cases, this means dealing with forms and all of their complexities.

Angular 2 is much more flexible than Angular 1 for handling forms â€” we are no longer restricted to relying solely on `ngModel`. Instead, we are given degrees of simplicity and power, depending on what a form needs to accomplish.

- [Template-Driven Forms](template-driven/template-driven_forms.md) - Use built-in directives to create straightforward form components, with minimal code
- [FormBuilder](form-builder/form-builder.md) - Use the provided APIs to handle more complex validation and subforms
