# Immutable.js

[Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) is a library that provides immutable generic collections.

## What is immutability?
**Immutability** is a design pattern where something that's been instantiated can't be modified. If we want to change the values of that thing, we must instead recreate it with the new values. Some JavaScript types are immutable, while others are mutable, meaning their value can change without having to recreate it. Let's explain this difference with some examples:

```typescript
let movie = {
  name: 'Star Wars',
  episode: 7
};

let myEp = yourEp = movie.episode;

movie.episode = 8;

console.log(myEp); // outputs 7
```

As you can see in this case, although we changed the value of `movie.episode`, the value of `myEp` didn't change. That's because `movie.episode`'s type, `number`, is immutable.

```typescript
let movie1 = {
  name: 'Star Wars',
  episode: 7
};

let movie2 = movie1;

movie2.episode = 8;

console.log(movie1.episode); // outputs 8
```

In this case, however, changing the value of episode on one object also changed the value of the other. That's because `movie1` and `movie2` are object types, which is mutable.

Of the JavaScript built-in types, these are immutable:
  - Boolean
  - Number
  - String
  - Symbol

These are mutable:
  - Object
  - Array
  - Function
