# Testing JSONP and XHR Backends

Some services take advantage of the JSONP or XHR module to fetch data instead of the traditional HTTP module. We utilize the same strategies for testing these services - create a mock back end, initialize the service, and test to see if the request our service made is correct, and if the data mocked through the back end makes it way successfully to the service. Fortunately services that rely on the XHR module are tested *exactly* the same was as services that use the Http module. The only difference is in which class is used to mock the back end. In services that use the Http module, the `MockBackend` class is used, in those that use XHR, the `XHRBackend` is used instead. Everything else remains the same.

Unfortunately services that use the JSONP module use a significantly different class for mocking the back end. The class `MockBrowserJsonp` is used for this scenario - [although it seems to still be under construction and may be subject to change](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/angular2/test/http/backends/jsonp_backend_spec.ts).
