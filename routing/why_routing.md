# Why Routing? ##

Routing allows us to express some aspects of the app's state in the URL. Unlike with server-side front-end solutions, this is optional - we can build the full app without ever changing the URL. Adding routing however, allows the user to go straight into certain aspects of the app. This is very convenient, as it can keep your application linkable, bookmarkable and allow the users to share links with others.

* Useful to maintain the state of the application
* Modular Applications
* Implementing the application based on the roles (certain roles have access to certain url's)
