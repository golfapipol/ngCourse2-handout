# Part 2: EcmaScript 6 and TypeScript Features #

The new version of JavaScript, "EcmaScript 6" or "ES6", offers a number of new features that extend the power of the language. (The language we usually call "JavaScript" is actually formally known as "EcmaScript") ES6 is not widely supported in today's browsers, so it needs to be transpiled to ES5. You can choose between several transpilers, but we'll be using TypeScript, which is what the Angular team users to write Angular 2. Angular 2 makes use of a number of features of ES6 and TypeScript.
