# ES6

During a ten day stretch in the nineteen ninties, JavaScript was written by
Brendan Eich. Twenty plus years later, the language is thriving.  There are
subsets, supersets, current versions, and an upcoming version.  ES6 is that
upcoming version, and it brings a lot of new features.

Some of the highlights:

- Template Strings
- Classes
- Arrow Functions
- Constants, and Block Scoped Variables
- ...spread, and ...rest
- Destructuring
- Modules
