# Workshop 0 - The Kitchen Sink

As discussed earlier in the training, there is a difference between containers, and presentational - or dumb components. Presentational components are small components that are meant to be reusable through-out the application, that have data and/or callbacks passed in, and emit events out. They do not know about the state of the application, or how they are being used.


To help get you started, check out the `workshop-0` branch.

```shell
$ git checkout -b workshop-0 origin/workshop-0
```

There you will find a simple application with a  `kitchen-sink` container, so if you start the application and navigate to: http://localhost:3000/kitchen-sink, you will see the start of a page that is meant to demonstrate each dumb component.

As we go through and complete the components, update the kitchen sink to make use of them.

The following items have already been completed for you for demonstration:

- Container
- Card
- Icons/CheckIcon
- Icons/UserIcon

There are place holders and skeletons for the rest of the components.
