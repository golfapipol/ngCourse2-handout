# Use Webpack 

Using a module loader like Webpack is essential for migrating to Angular 2, and
should already be part of every modern developer's tool set.  Webpack will make
it easy to manage all the different files that a modern, modular Angular 1.3+
project prescribes.  This includes bundling the application for distribution or 
deployment.

Using Webpack will also simplify a developer's Angular 2 workflow, since the
easiest way to work with Angular 2 is with TypeScript, or ES6.  Neither of which
works natively in contemporary browsers.
