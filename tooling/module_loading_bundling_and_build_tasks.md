# Module Loading, Bundling and Build Tasks: [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/what-is-webpack.html)

Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. It can bundle JavaScript, CSS, HTML or just about anything via additional loaders. Webpack can also be extended via plugins, for example minification and mangling can be done using the UglifyJS plugin for webpack.
